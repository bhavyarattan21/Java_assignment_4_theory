Project Title: City Library Digital Management System

Problem Statement:

The City Central Library has decided to digitize its operations to make book
management, membership services, and data tracking more efficient. They
need a Java-based application to handle book records, member details, and
transactions using File Handling and the Java Collections Framework.
The system must be capable of:

• Adding new books and members.

• Issuing and returning books.

• Storing and retrieving data from files for persistence.

• Using collections to efficiently search, sort, and manage records.
Project Objectives:

• Apply File Handling concepts to store and retrieve library data from
text and binary files.

• Implement Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue) to
manage records dynamically.

• Use Comparable and Comparator for sorting books and members by
different criteria.

• Practice Buffered I/O, Character Streams, and Byte Streams for
efficient file operations.

• Apply Generics in collections for type-safe data handling.
Learning Outcomes (COs):

• CO4.1: Use Java’s File Handling API for persistent storage of real-world
data.
• CO4.2: Implement the Java Collections Framework for dynamic data
management.
• CO4.3: Demonstrate sorting and searching using
Comparable/Comparator.
• CO4.4: Integrate I/O operations with collection-based data handling
for real-world scenarios.
